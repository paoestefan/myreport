      <h1>Our point</h1>
      <p>We decided to review how happiness scores have changed due to the global COVID crisis</p>
      <p>We just focus on the top & buttom 5 of this score so we could have a small population to analize</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>Have the top five changed?</h2>

      <img src="./Images/Top 5 happy countries 2020.png" alt="Top 5 happy countries 2020">
      <h3>Analysis</h3>
      <p>As we can see with the graphs above the top 2 countries (Finland & Denmark) have not changed of position between 2020 & 2019 as Iceland keeping firmly the 4° place, but for the 3° and 5° we see that Norway pass, taking Switzerland its place.</p>

      <img src="./Images/Last 5 happy countries 2020.png" alt="Button 5 happy countries 2020">
      <h3>Analysis</h3>
      <p>Surprisingly there is no change in the last 5 happy countries in the world for the years 2019 and 2020. Seems like nothing much has changed in these five countries that might have made their people happier</p>
